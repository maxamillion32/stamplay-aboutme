===================

**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform with [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/) to show you how to build a community driven landing page site, like [About.me](https://about.me/).**

*Owning your own personal homepage can have many benefits; from using it to promote your personal brand or work, as a hub to your social accounts, and to display on your business card. About.me is one of the most widely used personal homepage sites.*

In this tutorial weâ€™ll use the Stamplay platform and BackboneJS to show you how to build your own About.me site in super quick time.

This web app will allow users to:

* Log in with Facebook
* Create and edit their own personal page
* Publish a Post on their Facebook timeline after publishing their page
* Send compliment pages of other users
* Send a message to a page owner via a contact form

[This is what you'll build](https://aboutme.stamplayapp.com/).
